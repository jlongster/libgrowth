What is the biggest thing missing from your life? Seeing how your node
libraries grow over time, of course!

**libgrowth** uses some basic heuristics to make growth charts. Right
now it's specific to my stuff but it shouldn't be hard to generalize.

The only metric it graphs right now is the number of daily downloads,
grabbed from npm. This number is extremely estimated, but it should
serve a good basic growth indicator.
